    "<h2>Computer language</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer language translates the instructions that a human types into instructions that a computer understands and executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is relevant to know that a computer language follows strict rules to maintain a logic and avoid ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hello, Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred programming language for working with data today is **Python** (There are others like R, Scala, or Julia, but they are far behind in market share and the amount of functionality they offer for working with data).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"..\\imgs\\python.png\" width=\"10%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is great for 3 important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's easy to learn\n",
    "* It's easy to read (many other programming languages aren't!)\n",
    "* It's **open source**, which means it's free to use and, even better, other people in the Python community are constantly adding more functionality to the language for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>How does Python work? A quick understanding</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the general steps that you need to work with Python (think about it as a general process flow):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Writing code:** The first step in using Python is to write your code in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm.\n",
    "2. **Compiling/interpreting:** Once you have written your code, you need to run it. Python is an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before running. Instead, the Python interpreter reads the code line by line and executes it as it goes.\n",
    "3. **Execution:** During execution, the Python interpreter checks each line of code for syntax errors and runs the code as it goes. If there are any errors, the interpreter will report them and stop execution.\n",
    "4. **Result:** Once the code has been executed, it will produce a result. This could be anything from a printed message to a complex data analysis. The result can be saved to a file, printed to the console, or used in another part of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The importance of libraries to work in Python:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Reusability: Python libraries contain pre-written code that can be reused in different projects. This saves time and effort by not having to reinvent the wheel every time a new project is started.\n",
    "- Functionality: Libraries provide additional functionality that may not be available in the standard Python library. For example, the NumPy library provides functions for working with arrays and matrices, while the Pandas library provides tools for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- Efficiency: Libraries are often written in low-level programming languages, which are optimized for performance. This means that using a library can be faster than writing the same code from scratch in Python.\n",
    "- Collaboration: Python libraries are often open-source, which means that anyone can contribute to their development. This encourages collaboration between developers and ensures that the library is continually improved and updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while you are writting your code you will need to add libraries as an additional step. Some of the libraries we will study are: Matplotlib (graphics), Pandas (Read files), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to execute Python code?\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a Python (`.py`) file in Windows, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Command Prompt: You can open the Command Prompt in Windows by pressing the `Windows key + R` to open the Run dialog box, typing `cmd`, and then pressing `Enter`.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where the `.py` file is located: You can navigate to the directory where your `.py` file is located using the `cd` command in the Command Prompt. For example, if your `.py` file is located in the `Documents` folder on your desktop, you would type `cd C:\\Users\\<your_username>\\Documents` in the Command Prompt and press `Enter`.\n",
    "3. Run the `.py` file: Once you're in the directory where the `.py` file is located, you can run it by typing `python <filename>.py` in the Command Prompt, where `<filename>` is the name of your `.py` file. For example, if your `.py` file is named `my_script.py`, you would type `python my_script.py` in the Command Prompt and press `Enter`.\n",
    "4. Check the output: If your `.py` file produces any output, you should see it in the Command Prompt after you run the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also run a `.py` file in Windows by double-clicking on the file in Windows Explorer, which should open the file in the Python interpreter. However, this method may not always work if the Python interpreter is not properly configured on your computer."

    "5. Save and share your notebook: Once you have finished your notebook, you can save it by clicking on the \"Save\" button in the toolbar or pressing \"Ctrl+S\" on your keyboard. You can also share your notebook by exporting it to a variety of formats including HTML, PDF, and Markdown.\n",
